# Description 

You need to implement Proxy Server component as described below

## Workflow

```
+----------+ open/close order request +----------------+ open/close order request  +-----------------+
|          +-------------------------->                +-------------------------->+                 |
|  Client  | open/close order response|     Proxy      | open/close order response |  Order server   |
|          <--------------------------+                <<--------------------------+                 |
+----------+                          +----------------+                           +-----------------+
```

A Client connects to the proxy-server via WS, the proxy-server creates a WS-connection per client to the order server.
A client sends order requests asynchronously.
Proxy-server filters order requests according to the business logic described bellow and if the filter passes the proxy-server sends the order request to the order server.
Proxy-server receives order response from the order server and sends order response to the client initiated the request.

## Business logic of proxy-server

The proxy-server must ensure:
1. there are not more than N opened orders per client per instrument at the moment of time
2. the sum of volumes of opened orders is not more than S per client per instrument at the moment of time

## Data format

## order request format

client_id (uint32) | id (uint32) | req_type (uint8) | order_kind (uint8) | volume (float64) | instrument (string, max len=8)

- client_id - id of a client, sending a Message
- id - id of a request, monotonically increases only
- req_type - type of the request: 1 - open order, 2 - close order
- order_kind - kind of an order: 1 - buy, 2 - sell
- volume - volume of an order
- instrument - buy/sell order instrument, e.g., XLMEUR, USDEUR, USDRUB

## order response format

id (uint32) | code (uint16)

- id - id of a corresponding request
- code - result code: 0 - success, other - fail, see codes

### Result codes

1 - number of open orders exceeds
2 - sum volumes of orders exceeds
3 - other error

## Contents of this directory

- protocol.go - OrderRequest, OrderResponse structs and codecs.
- cmd/server/main.go - server cli. It stats server, and send responses with 0 result code on each request. You can run it in a terminal with command `go run cmd/server/main.go`
- cmd/client/main.go - client cli sending request to the server with a certain interval between two consequent requests. You can run it in a terminal with command `go run cmd/client/main.go -inst XLMEUR -inter 0.5ms`

## What expected to get as a result

- cmd/proxy/main.go - a cli starting a proxy server according to the business logic described. In case of questions appear come up with an aswer and document the decision made in a comment line.
